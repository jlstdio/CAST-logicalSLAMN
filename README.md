The data augmentation code will be released soon! The training code is available in the `cast-vla` repo linked in this repo, the [CAST dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/catglossop/CAST-dataset) and an existing [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/catglossop/CounterfactualVLA) are available on HuggingFace. 

To get started with training your own model with the CAST dataset, download and unzip the CAST dataset. Follow the instructions in the `cast-vla` repo to start your own training run. 

To start using CounterfactualVLA, download the checkpoint and follow the instructions for inference in the `cast-vla` repo.
